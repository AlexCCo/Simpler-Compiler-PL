# Simpler-Compiler-PL
Simpler Compiler PL is a project developed to learn how a compiler is it made. 
It is done by students from Universidad Complutense de Madrid.
 
The project will have two parts for each phase of the compiler:
1. A manual implementation made by us.
2. An automatic implementation made by some tools like:
   1. [JLex](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/) a ***lexical analyzer***,
   also called [*Scanner*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis), generator written
   in Java
   2. [JavaCC](https://javacc.github.io/javacc/) a ***syntax analyzer***, also called [Parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing),
   and also written in Java
